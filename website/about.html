        <p>Microsoft Azure</p>
        <p>I have hands-on experience designing, implementing, and managing solutions in Microsoft Azure, with a strong focus on infrastructure-as-code, automation, and secure cloud architecture. My expertise includes provisioning and integrating core Azure services such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Web Apps, Cosmos DB, Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD), and Microsoft Entra ID. I’ve deployed scalable applications using Terraform and OpenTofu, incorporating CI/CD workflows via GitHub Actions to streamline infrastructure deployment. Additionally, I’ve implemented Palo Alto VPN configurations to simulate office IP environments for secure remote access to Azure VMs. My work often emphasizes integration—ensuring networking, identity, and security controls work seamlessly across services—alongside best practices like zero trust architecture, managed identities, and landing zone design aligned with the Cloud Adoption Framework.</p>
